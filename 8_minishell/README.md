# MiniShell

*As beautiful as a shell*

![125/100 score](./minishell_success.png)

The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. Yes, your little bash or zsh. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors

## Statement

The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to english.

With Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when Windows didn’t exist...

It must show a prompt, have a working History, search and lunch executables, implement builtins (echo, cd, pwd, unset, env, exit), simple quoting, double quoting, redirections, pipes, environment variables, $?, SIGQUIT, SIGINT & EOF. 


### For bonus:

Logic: &&, || with parenthesis for priorities.

Wildcard * should work for the current working directory.

Enjoy!
